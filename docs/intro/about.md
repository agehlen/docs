prooph software Event Engine takes away all the boring, time consuming parts of event sourcing to speed up
development of event sourced applications and increase the fun. It can be used for prototypes as well as full featured applications.

## Origin

Event Engine was originally designed as a "workshop framework" for CQRS and Event Sourcing and is inspired by the **Dreyfus model**.

### Beginner friendly

> The Dreyfus model distinguishes five levels of competence, from novice to mastery. At the absolute beginner level people execute tasks based on “rigid adherence to taught rules or plans”. Beginners need recipes. They don’t need a list of parts, or a dozen different ways to do the same thing. Instead what works are step by step instructions that they can internalize. As they practice them over time they learn the reasoning behind them, and learn to deviate from them and improvise, but they first need to feel like they’re doing something.

### Rapid Application Development
It turned out that Event Engine is not only a very good CQRS and Event Sourcing learning framework but that the same concept
can be used for rapid application development (RAD). RAD frameworks focus on developer happiness and coding speed.
Both can be achieved by using conventions, which allow the framework to do a lot of work "under the hood"
Developers can focus on the important part: **developing the application**.

## Event Engine Flavours

Event Engine Flavours make it possible to turn a rapidly developed prototype into a rock solid application.
You can switch from the default **PrototypingFlavour** to either the **FunctionalFlavour** or **OopFlavour**. Finally, you can implement your own
Flavour to build your very own CQRS / ES framework.
